# Web based Facial Authentication system
This is a web based facial log in/ Sign up website which uses Facial recognition for user authentication.

It uses flask **server** for running the keras neural network model. 
The model runs on the server side and accepts requests from clients.

Facial recognition is based on Facenet model.

For installing
1. install `pipenv` using `pip3 install --user pipenv` \
2. cd to your working directory
3. activate the environment by typing `pipenv shell`\
4. once environment is activated, you can install the required packages using `pipenv install` or `pipenv run install -r requirements.txt`\

For running:
1. first run
python keras_server.py
2. go to browser and type **localhost:5000** to access the site
3. enjoy
